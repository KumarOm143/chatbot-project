# Chatbot Project

This project involves the development of an interactive chatbot using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot can engage in conversations, respond to user queries, and provide helpful information. It uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for processing user inputs and generating responses.

## Features
- **Interactive Conversations**: The chatbot can process and understand user inputs, providing appropriate responses.
- **Predefined Responses**: The chatbot has a set of predefined responses for common queries.
- **Fallback Responses**: If an input is not recognized, the chatbot provides a fallback response to continue the interaction.
- **Simple and User-Friendly**: Easy to use interface, type questions and receive responses.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for the chatbot.
- **NLTK**: A powerful library for natural language processing in Python.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KumarOm143/chatbot-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd chatbot-project
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install nltk
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the chatbot script:
    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```
2. Type your queries in the terminal and interact with the chatbot.

## Future Improvements
- Adding machine learning techniques for intent recognition.
- Expanding the chatbotâ€™s knowledge base.
- Enhancing conversation flow with context-aware responses.
